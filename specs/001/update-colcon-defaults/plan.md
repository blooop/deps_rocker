# Plan for updating colcon defaults in ros_generic

1. Analyze the provided JSON and current defaults.yaml
2. Map new values to the YAML structure, merging or overriding as needed
3. Update /home/ags/projects/deps_rocker/deps_rocker/extensions/ros_generic/configs/defaults.yaml
4. Validate YAML syntax and structure
5. Ensure all new keys are documented and compatible with colcon
6. Commit only the contents of the new spec folder
7. Fully implement the specification
