# Implementation Plan

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Fix in `auto.py`
**File**: `deps_rocker/extensions/auto/auto.py`

**Change**: In `_detect_glob_patterns` method (line 155-232):
- Removed `import fnmatch`
- Changed matching logic from:
  ```python
  matches = [f for f in all_files if fnmatch.fnmatch(f, pattern)]
  ```
  to:
  ```python
  matches = [f for f in all_files if Path(f).match(pattern)]
  ```

**Impact**: This fix applies to ALL auto-detected extensions, not just ROS:
- `package.xml` for ROS packages
- `Cargo.toml` for Rust projects
- `package.json` for npm projects
- All wildcard patterns like `*.py`, `*.cpp`, etc.

### 2. Test Coverage
**File**: `test/test_auto_extension.py`

Added new test `test_detect_ros_in_subdirectory`:
- Creates nested directory structure: `my_ros_pkg/package.xml`
- Verifies `ros_jazzy` extension is detected
- Ensures fix works for the common ROS workspace structure

### 3. Verification Steps
1. ✅ Ran full CI suite - all tests pass
2. ✅ Manually tested on `ros2/demos` repository - found all 20 `package.xml` files
3. ✅ Verified existing tests still pass (no regressions)

## Benefits
- Fixes detection for nested ROS packages
- Improves detection for other nested file patterns (Cargo.toml, package.json, etc.)
- More consistent with glob pattern expectations
- Enables explicit `**` recursive patterns if needed in future
