1. Execute `pixi run ci` to capture the current failures.
2. Diagnose failing components (tests, linters, builds) and map to code areas.
3. Implement fixes iteratively, re-running targeted commands as needed.
4. Re-run `pixi run ci` until it passes cleanly.
5. Prepare final commit with updated code and documentation.
